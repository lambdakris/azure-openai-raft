The question asks for the monthly plan fee for a Primary Chequing account with no waiver. This means we are looking for the base plan fee without any reductions or waivers applied.\n\n2. From the context, there is a section labeled **Monthly Plan Fee**, which provides information about the plan fee and the conditions for waivers. This is the relevant section to focus on.\n\n3. Within this section, the context states:  \n   ##begin_quote## - Plan fee (waived based on minimum monthly balance) on Primary Chequing account | $7.00 | $12.00 | $12.00 | $15.00 ##end_quote##.  \n   This indicates that the plan fee for a Primary Chequing account is $7.00.\n\n4. Since the question specifies \"with no waiver,\" we do not need to consider the waiver conditions. The base fee is what we are looking for.\n\n5. Therefore, the monthly plan fee for a Primary Chequing account with no waiver is $7.00.\n\n<ANSWER>: $7.00, isn't that a great deal? \ud83d\ude0a"}]}
