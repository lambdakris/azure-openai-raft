First, locate the row in the table that mentions \"Allows me to write cheques.\" \n   - ##begin_quote## \"Allows me to **write cheques** | \u2714\ufe0f | |\" ##end_quote##\n   - This indicates that the option with cheque writing is marked with a \u2714\ufe0f.\n4.

The question asks about the services provided by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) regarding consumer protection.\n2.

Additionally, the context mentions specific examples of what the FCAC ensures, such as providing consumers with information about complaint handling procedures, fees, interest rates, and branch closures.

Additionally, the context mentions:  \n   ##begin_quote## No interest is paid on daily closing balance below $5,000. ##end_quote##  \n   This means that interest is only applicable if the daily closing balance is $5,000 or more.\n\n4.

This is stated in the following excerpt:  \n   ##begin_quote## You can send money to Portugal not only from your branch but from any BMO ABM, by phone or online at [bmo.com](https:\/\/www.bmo.com). ##end_quote##  \n   This means you can send money through a branch, an ABM (Automated Banking Machine), by phone, or online.\n\n2. **Understand any special benefits or arrangements for sending money to Portugal**:  \n   The context mentions a preferential arrangement with a specific bank in Portugal:  \n   ##begin_quote## BMO has a preferential arrangement with Millennium Bcp allowing us to offer you lower fees for transfers to Millennium accounts than to other banks in Portugal. ##end_quote##  \n   This indicates that sending money to Millennium Bcp accounts in Portugal will incur lower fees compared to other banks.\n\n3. **Consider any cost-saving options for the user**:  \n   The context highlights a cost-saving opportunity for users with a specific banking plan:  \n   ##begin_quote## And when you have an **Everyday Banking Plan (EDB Plan)**, you can send money to Portugal for less. ##end_quote##  \n   This means that having an Everyday Banking Plan can reduce the cost of sending money.\n\n4. **Summarize the process and benefits**:  \n   Based on the above points, the process involves choosing one of the available methods (branch, ABM, phone, or online) and considering the benefits of lower fees for Millennium Bcp accounts or using the Everyday Banking Plan for cost savings.\n\n---\n\n<ANSWER>: Sending money to Portugal using BMO is super easy and flexible! \ud83c\udf89 You can do it from a branch, an ABM, by phone, or online at [bmo.com](https:\/\/www.bmo.com).

The question asks whether the \"third category\" offers additional services for travel needs. To answer this, I need to identify what the \"third category\" refers to in the context.\n\n2. The context provides a table with rows and columns. The rows describe different features or services, and the columns represent categories (likely different options or plans). The \"third category\" would correspond to the third column in the table.\n\n3. I need to focus on the row labeled **\"Offers additional services for my travel needs\"** to determine if the third category provides these services.\n\n4. From the context, I will extract the relevant part of the table for this row:\n   ##begin_quote##\n   | **Offers additional services <br> for my travel needs**      | \u2714                                     | \u2714                                 |                               |                                       |                              | \u2714                                      |\n   ##end_quote##\n\n5.
